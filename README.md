# Kalory
Presentational project as software developer

# Overview

Project consists of three parts - backend (java, Spring), frontend (react, redux) and infra part for running all together locally (docker, docker-compose)

# Disclaimer

This project is NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BE production ready, it's just showing how I used to structure Spring/React projects and how I used to write and test my code

# How-to 

```
1. Install docker & docker-compose locally 
2. Run `./docker-compose up` 
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
4. Use `client/password` and `admin/password` for browsing the app.
```
