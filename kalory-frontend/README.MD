## Project overview

That's a sample project to present my skills (obviously - quite medium) as a front-end developer.
It can show which stack I tend to use when I face some front-end task. It also can show how I structure my code inside the project.
It's NOT PRODUCTION READY project, it's just a result of several calm and frosty evenings.

I know that elements like Button, Table, Dropdown - shouldn't be implemented from the scratch, but it was a practice for me.

## Tech stack

- react
- redux (RTK, RTK Query)
- classnames
- react-datepicker
- react-icons
- recharts
- logo.com (for logo, branding and color scheme)

## Nice-to-have

- Implement adaptive mobile layout
- Provide smoother design :)
- Imtroduce product auto-complete for smoother consumption tracking
- Improve form validation - show invalid field and validation message
- Shrink production package size (e.g. introduce webpack & gzip)
- Add images for products

## How-to

1. Start back-end (see kalory-backend project), by default it's run on 8080
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start` / `npm test`
4. Open `localhost:3000` - you should see a login form, use `client/password` or `admin/password` credentials for browsing.
